# alona-engine
 physics engine - easier simulations on browser

# A Humble beginning
 Hey, you! 
 This is a WIP project, and I've just started it, so there's no much to see in this sea.
 But, if you want to run the simulation and orbit around feel free to do it.
 
 **Note:** Don't forget to compile the TS before doing it.
 > npm install
 
 > npm run dev
